			"And where's Mr. Campbell?" Charlie asked.

			"Gone to Switzerland. Mr. Campbell's a pretty sick man, Mr. Wales."

			"I'm sorry to hear that. And George Hardt?" Charlie inquired.

			"Back in America, gone to work."

			He was not really disappointed to find Paris was so empty. But the stillness in the Ritz bar was strange and portentous. It was not an American bar any more--he felt polite in it, and not as if he owned it. It had gone back into France.

When he turned into the bar he travelled the twenty feet of green carpet with his eyes fixed straight ahead by old habit; and then, with his foot firmly on the rail, he turned and surveyed the room, encountering only a single pair of eyes that fluttered up from a newspaper in the corner. Charlie asked for the head barman, Paul, who in the latter days of the bull market had come to work in his own custom-built car--disembarking, however, with due nicety at the nearest corner. But Paul was at his country house today and Alix giving him information.
